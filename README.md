# Ridonomi Backend

Backend service for Ridonomi – a ride price comparison platform that evaluates
pricing across multiple providers and recommends the cheapest option.

## Tech Stack
- FastAPI
- Python
- SQLAlchemy
- JWT Authentication

## Current Status
- User authentication implemented
- Ride pricing and booking logic in progress

## Why Backend-only
This project intentionally focuses on backend system design, pricing logic,
and API scalability instead of frontend UI.
